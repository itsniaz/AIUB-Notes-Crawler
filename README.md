# AIUB-Notes-Crawler

This a simple script written in Python 3 in that crawls my university [portal](portal.aiub.edu) with student credentials and downloads all the uploaded course materials automatically and saves them folderwise. Any AIUB student can use it for downloading their courses material from their portal of all the semesters that they have completed.
