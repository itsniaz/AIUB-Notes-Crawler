# AIUB-Notes-Crawler

This a simple script written in Python 3 that crawls my [university](https://www.aiub.edu) [portal](portal.aiub.edu) with student credentials and downloads all the uploaded course materials automatically and saves them folderwise. Any [AIUB](https://www.aiub.edu) student can use it for downloading their courses material from their portal of all the semesters that they have completed.
